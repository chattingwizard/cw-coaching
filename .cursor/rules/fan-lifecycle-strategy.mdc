# Fan Lifecycle Strategy — Chatting Wizard (Core Business Rule)

This is a **core business strategy** that must be reflected in ALL systems: scripts, training, coaching, dashboards, and decision-making.

## The 48-72 Hour Rule

The first **48-72 hours** after a fan subscribes is the highest-value window. This is when the fan is most likely to spend money. After this window closes without a purchase, the fan's likelihood of converting drops significantly.

## Two Fan Categories

### 1. New Subscriber (First 48-72h) — "Potential Spender"
- **Goal:** Complete a FULL sexting session with at least one PPV sale
- **Why:** Completing a sexting session creates a strong emotional connection ("we finished together"), which drives retention and repeat purchases
- **Pricing strategy:** Welcome Journey uses **intentionally lower prices** than normal to reduce the barrier to that first purchase. The priority is CONVERSION, not maximizing per-sale revenue
- **Chatter behavior:**
  - Follow the Welcome Journey scripts (W → AF → R → TB → S)
  - Be aggressive about moving through phases — don't let rapport drag on forever
  - Use lower PPV prices as designed in the welcome sequence
  - After completed sexting: invest HEAVILY in aftercare — this is where the long-term connection is built
  - The aftercare after a first sexting is more important than the aftercare after a 10th sexting

### 2. Time Waster (48-72h+ with $0 spent)
- **Definition:** A fan who has been subscribed for 48-72+ hours and has NOT spent any money
- **Goal:** Extract ANY revenue possible through creative selling
- **Why:** This fan is unlikely to go through a full sexting journey. They've shown they're not willing to pay at normal engagement levels
- **Chatter behavior:**
  - STOP trying to force the standard sexting journey — it's not working for this fan
  - Switch to **bundle/promotion selling**: "Hey babe, I have a special deal just for you today 💕"
  - Offer discounted bundles, limited-time deals, special packages
  - Lower prices if needed — some revenue > no revenue
  - Be creative: custom offers, themed bundles, holiday specials
  - Don't waste excessive time — if they still won't buy after offers, deprioritize
  - These fans are LOWEST PRIORITY in your inbox queue

## Why This Matters

The entire script system, pricing, and journey structure is built around this dual approach:
- **New subs** get the premium, high-effort treatment because they have the highest ROI
- **Time wasters** get efficient, deal-based treatment because extended effort on them has diminishing returns

## Impact on Systems

| System | How This Strategy Applies |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Scripts** | Welcome Journey prices are lower than standard. Time Waster scripts should focus on offers/bundles |
| **Training** | Chatters must understand WHY welcome prices are lower and WHY aftercare matters so much after first sexting |
| **Coaching** | TLs should flag chatters who waste time on Time Wasters instead of focusing on new subs |
| **Dashboard** | Track conversion within first 48-72h as a key metric |
| **Fan Assessment** | First check: How long has this fan been subscribed? Have they spent anything? |
